## Features
- Initialize a new Wit repository
- Stage and commit changes
- Create and switch between branches
- Merge branches
- View commit history
- Track changes and file modifications
- Ignore specific files or directories using .witignore
- Revert to previous commits
- Push and pull changes to remote repositories
